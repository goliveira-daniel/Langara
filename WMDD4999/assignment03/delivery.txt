Hello Nahan,

Here's the link for my assignment:
https://github.com/goliveira-daniel/Langara/tree/master/WMDD4999/assignment03

I removed my amazon keys from the files but left a dotenv mention to it. Create a file named '.env' at the root directory of my assignment and paste the lines below:
awsAccessKeyId = 'AKIAI5XKEMGCPIMO7B2A';
awsSecretAccessKey = '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';

the README.MD has all the instructions to test this assignment.

Thanks,

Daniel
