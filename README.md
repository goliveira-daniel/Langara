# Langara

This repo contains my assignments, homeworks and any kind of deliverable I produced throughout my coursework at Langara College for the Web and Mobile Developer program.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Most projects use Node.JS and NPM. Some courses will require a Java or Android IDE as well. 

For project using NPM, navigate to the folder containing package.json file and type 'npm install' 

## Deployment

Again, different projects have different deploys. Most website use a simple surge hosting. Projects using databases are likely to have only local deploy.

## Built With

Inumerous things were used, here's a small list of tools, libraries and others components mostly frequent used. Links for them might or might not be provided. Google it ;)
